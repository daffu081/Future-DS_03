🚦 Task 3 Completed – Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
🔍 Project under the Future Intern program

I'm thrilled to complete Task 3: Road Accident Analysis Dashboard, where I built an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze road accident data. The goal was to identify high-risk locations, accident trends, and factors affecting road safety.

📊 What I Did:

Transformed and cleaned raw data in Power Query

Created time-based visuals (hour, weekday)

Mapped accident hotspots

Filtered by weather, vehicle type, urban/rural area

Used DAX for custom insights and KPIs

🛠 Tools & Skills:
Power BI (DAX, Power Query, Maps) | Excel | SQL
Data visualization | Predictive thinking | Insight extraction

💡 Outcome: A dashboard that could support traffic policy, safety planning, and emergency response strategies.

This task boosted my skills in real-world data analysis and dashboard storytelling.
Grateful to the Future Intern team for the opportunity!
